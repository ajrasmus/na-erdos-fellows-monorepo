## Notebooks Folder

The `notebooks` folder contains the various scripting templates and pipeline notebooks that are developed and deployed by the teams in the fellows program.

Each notebook follows a specific naming scheme to maintain consistency and readability.

##

### Naming Scheme

Each notebook should be named using the following format:


*team_name_NotebookPurpose.ipynb*
- **team_name**: The name of the team responsible for the notebook.
- **NotebookPurpose**: The function or purpose the notebook serves, written in Upper Camel Case (also known as Pascal Case).

### Example

For instance, if team `chlorofish` develops a data preprocessing pipeline into a notebook coding template, the file should be named:

*chlorofish_PreprocessingPipeline.ipynb*

##

### Upper Camel Case Convention

Please ensure to use Upper Camel Case for the model name. 

For example, if team `chlorofish` builds a data model template, the notebook file can be named:

*model_chlorofish_DataModelTemplate.ipynb*

or

*model_chlorofish_DataModel_Template.ipynb*

but not

*model_chlorofish_datamodelTemplate.ipynb*

By following this naming convention, we can keep our notebook directory well organized and easy to navigate for all users.
